# Sidebar Navigation Rate Limiting Fix

## Problem
When users clicked quickly on sidebar menu items, they were getting the error "Failed to fetch data to many request" due to rapid API calls being triggered by each screen's initialization.

## Root Cause
Each sidebar menu navigation triggered `Get.off()` which loaded a new screen, and each screen's `initState` and `onInit` methods made multiple API calls. Rapid clicking caused multiple simultaneous API requests, triggering the rate limiter.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Navigation Helper (`lib/utils/navigation_helper.dart`)
- Added debouncing mechanism for navigation
- Prevents rapid navigation clicks from triggering multiple screen loads
- Uses the existing `RateLimiter` utility for consistent behavior
- Optional loading indicator (disabled for sidebar navigation)

### 2. Updated Sidebar Menu (`lib/widgets/custom_appbar/custom_appbar.dart`)
- Replaced all `Get.off()` calls with `NavigationHelper.navigateWithDebounce()`
- Each navigation has a unique key for proper debouncing
- 500ms debounce delay prevents rapid clicks
- No loading indicators to maintain smooth UX

### 3. Key Features
- **Debouncing**: Only the last click within 500ms is processed
- **Unique Keys**: Each menu item has its own debounce key
- **Rate Limiting**: Existing API rate limiting still works
- **User Experience**: No visual loading indicators for smooth navigation

## Usage
```dart
// Before
onTap: () => Get.off(() => ScreenHome()),

// After  
onTap: () => NavigationHelper.navigateWithDebounce(
  key: 'home_navigation',
  screenBuilder: () => ScreenHome(),
  showLoadingIndicator: false,
),
```

## Benefits
1. **Prevents Rate Limiting Errors**: No more "too many requests" errors
2. **Better UX**: Smooth navigation without loading delays
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All sidebar navigation uses the same debouncing logic
4. **Maintainable**: Centralized navigation logic in helper class

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the sidebar menu
2. Click rapidly on any menu item multiple times
3. Verify only one navigation occurs
4. Check that no rate limiting errors appear
5. Confirm smooth navigation experience
